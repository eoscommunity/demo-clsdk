You want to buy a dog? You've come to the right place! We have many different dog names to choose from. If you are not sure what to name your dog, this contract also supplies informative books about dog names, or you can use Google to help you name your dog. Sometimes people ask us what dog breed they'll get. Simple, it's random. If you want a poodle and we supply you with a husky, simply pretend it's a poodle.

Dogs come in many different sizes, colors, and designs. No matter what the design, your dog will love you and not care that you pretend it's a different breed. It also won't care if you call it a mutt, as long as you always do it using a happy voice.
